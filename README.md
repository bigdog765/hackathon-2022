Overview of what was done
           -THE PURPOSE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO HELP THE USER TRACK THEIR DAY-TO-DAY TASKS USING A TO-DO LIST. 
           We approached the problem thinking that if a user is stuck at home, he/she might have some tasks that they would want to complete in a timely manner. so, we came up with the idea of developing a to-do list with a timer. This application will help any user to be good at managing their day to day task along with teaching them how to use their time efficiently.  
           
           THE TO-DO LIST WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION:​

           USERS CAN ADD A TASK ​ 

           USERS CAN DELETE A TASK​

           USERS CAN MARK or CHECK OFF A TASK by clicking on it ​

           USERS CAN TRACK A TASK USING A TIMER​

           THE APP also DISPLAY MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES EVERY TIME THE USER CLICKS TO DISPLAY.​
